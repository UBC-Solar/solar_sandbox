# Welcome to the UBC Solar Sandbox!

This repository is a place for members to work on prototypes and proof of concept projects.

### Usage
1. Create a new branch in the repo. 
    * Follow the same standards as the `firmware_v3` repo.  
2. On the new branch, change directory into `/Projects`. 
    * **Do all development inside this folder**.  
3. When you are ready for reviews, create a PR. This way, a lead can look at all the changes in one place.
