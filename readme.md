# Welcome to the UBC Solar Sandbox!

This repository is a place for members to work on prototypes and proof of concept projects.

### How to use
Create a new branch in the repo. Follow the same standards as the firmware repo.  
On the new branch, create a new folder in /projects. Do all development inside this folder.  
When you are ready for reviews, create a PR. This way, a lead can look at all the changes in one place.
